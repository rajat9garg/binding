## Current Focus
- Resolve Flyway compatibility issues with PostgreSQL 15.13
- Implement database schema migrations
- Enhance health check endpoint with database connectivity check
- Set up proper logging and monitoring

## Recent Changes
### 2025-05-24
- Downgraded PostgreSQL from 16.9 to 15.13 for better tooling compatibility
- Disabled Flyway auto-configuration due to PostgreSQL 15.13 compatibility issues
- Implemented basic health check endpoint at `/api/v1/health`
- Configured JOOQ for type-safe SQL queries
- Set up basic project structure following Spring Boot best practices

## Key Decisions
### 2025-05-24 - Temporary Disable Flyway
**Issue/Context:** Flyway 9.16.1 has compatibility issues with PostgreSQL 15.13  
**Decision:** Disabled Flyway auto-configuration as a temporary workaround  
**Rationale:** Needed to unblock development while compatibility issues are resolved  
**Impact:** Database migrations need to be managed manually until Flyway is re-enabled  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-05-24 - PostgreSQL Version Selection
**Issue/Context:** Need to balance latest features with tooling compatibility  
**Decision:** Downgraded from PostgreSQL 16.9 to 15.13  
**Rationale:** Better compatibility with existing tooling and libraries  
**Impact:** Application now uses PostgreSQL 15.13 instead of the latest version  
**Status:** Implemented

## Action Items

  **Owner:** @[name]  
  **Planned Start:** [date]

## Current Metrics
- **API Availability:** 100% (target: 99.9%)
- **Database Connection Time:** < 100ms (target: < 200ms)
- **Health Check Response Time:** < 50ms (target: < 100ms)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully set up Spring Boot application with PostgreSQL
- Implemented basic health check endpoint
- Configured JOOQ for type-safe database access
- Resolved initial database connectivity issues
- Established basic project structure and coding standards

## Known Issues
- **Flyway Compatibility with PostgreSQL 15.13**
  - Impact: High (Blocks database migrations)
  - Status: Investigating
  - Next Steps: Test with different Flyway versions or implement custom migration solution

- **Manual Database Initialization**
  - Impact: Medium (Development overhead)
  - Status: In Progress
  - Next Steps: Implement proper database initialization scripts

- **Basic Health Check Implementation**
  - Impact: Low (Functional but basic)
  - Status: Pending Enhancement
  - Next Steps: Enhance with database connectivity check and metrics
