# ItemController Development: Complete Iteration Log

## Initial Attempt (23:30 - 23:32)
```kotlin
// First version - Basic structure
@RestController
class ItemApiController(
    private val itemService: ItemService
) : ItemsApi {
    // Methods not implemented yet
}
```
**Error**: Compilation failed - Missing method implementations

## Second Attempt (23:32 - 23:33)
- Added all required method stubs from ItemsApi
- Used `super` calls as placeholders
- **Error**: Compilation failed - Missing generated code

## Third Attempt (23:33 - 23:34)
- Ran `./gradlew clean openApiGenerate`
- Verified generated files in `build/generated/openapi`
- **Issue**: IDE not recognizing generated sources

## Fourth Attempt (23:34 - 23:35)
- Added source directory to build.gradle.kts:
  ```kotlin
  sourceSets.main {
      java.srcDirs("${buildDir}/generated/openapi/src/main/kotlin")
  }
  ```
- **Error**: Still seeing unresolved references

## Fifth Attempt (23:35 - 23:36)
- Added explicit task dependencies:
  ```kotlin
  tasks.compileKotlin {
      dependsOn("openApiGenerate")
  }
  ```
- **Issue**: Type mismatches between service and API models

## Sixth Attempt (23:36 - 23:37)
- Added mapping functions between Instant and OffsetDateTime
- **Error**: Still seeing type conversion issues

## Seventh Attempt (23:37 - 23:38)
- Simplified controller to bare minimum
- Kept only one endpoint working
- **Error**: Still issues with BigDecimal vs Double

## Eighth Attempt (23:38 - 23:39)
- Added explicit type conversions for all numeric fields
- **Error**: Method signature mismatches

## Ninth Attempt (23:39 - 23:40)
- Verified all method signatures against generated interface
- Fixed parameter names and return types
- **Status**: Compilation successful, but endpoints not fully implemented

## Key Learnings from Failures
1. **Code Generation**
   - Must run `openApiGenerate` before compilation
   - IDE sometimes needs to be refreshed to see generated sources

2. **Type Safety**
   - Be explicit with type conversions
   - Create separate mapping functions for complex conversions

3. **Incremental Development**
   - Better to implement one endpoint at a time
   - Verify each step before moving to the next

## Current State
- Basic controller structure is in place
- All methods are stubbed out
- Need to implement actual business logic
- Need to add proper error handling

## Next Steps
1. Implement one endpoint at a time
2. Add unit tests for each endpoint
3. Add proper error handling
4. Implement input validation
